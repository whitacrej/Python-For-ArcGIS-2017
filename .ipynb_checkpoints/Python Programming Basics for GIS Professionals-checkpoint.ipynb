    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming tools are now a standard feature within GIS software packages and allow professionals to automate, speed up, and become more precise in their analytic work. This workshop is designed for GIS professionals and students who have little to no experience or exposure to computer programming. Core programming concepts related to GIS work will be presented using the Python programming language. The workshop will be focused on guiding attendees through hands-on modules designed to provide the essential skills to programmatically manipulate data as part of a GIS workflow. This workshop is designed to be preparation for the afternoon workshop on Getting Started with Python in ArcGIS but may be taken independently.\n",

Additionally, he teaches a myriad of GIS workshops for beginner to advanced users and helps manage the Library's GIS data and software assets. He is also a central resource for the GIS community on campus to promote the use of GIS in research. Mr. Whitacre holds a Master of Science in Geography and was previously the GIS Manager for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.\n",

As a GIS Specialist there, her work is currently split between FEMA’s Risk Mapping, Assessment and Planning program (Risk MAP), and the Midwestern Regional Climate Center (MRCC).  She started using Model Builder in 2007 to better catalog and streamline workflows.  Upon starting with the MRCC in 2010, she realized the power of Python scripts and hasn’t looked back!\n"
