    "**Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on Python Programming Basics for GIS Professionals but open to anyone with some programming experience, this workshop will expand on those skills to further use Python in ArcGIS. The workshop will focus on the ArcPy Python site package to expand geoprocessing capabilities with Python scripts. Participants will learn to build multiple standalone geoprocessing scripts covering different GIS tasks and workflows. The workshop will also cover how to create scripting tools in ArcGIS toolboxes for reuse and sharing. Participants will finish with the skills to explore more resources and options for utilizing Python in ArcGIS.\n",

    "\n",
    "> ArcPy is a site package that builds on (and is a successor to) the successful arcgisscripting module. Its goal is to create the cornerstone for a useful and productive way to perform geographic data analysis, data conversion, data management, and map automation with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This package provides a rich and native Python experience offering code completion (type a keyword and a dot to get a pop-up list of properties and methods supported by that keyword; select one to insert it) and reference documentation for each function, module, and class.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The additional power of using ArcPy within Python is the fact that Python is a general-purpose programming language. It is interpreted and dynamically typed and is suited for interactive work and quick prototyping of one-off programs known as scripts while being powerful enough to write large applications in. ArcGIS applications written with ArcPy benefit from the development of additional modules in numerous niches of Python by GIS professionals and programmers from many different disciplines.\n",
