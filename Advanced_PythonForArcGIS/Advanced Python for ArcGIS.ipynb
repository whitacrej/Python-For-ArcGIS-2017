    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on Python Programming Basics for GIS Professionals but open to anyone with some programming experience, this workshop will expand on those skills to further use Python in ArcGIS. The workshop will focus on the ArcPy Python site package to expand geoprocessing capabilities with Python scripts. Participants will learn to build multiple standalone geoprocessing scripts covering different GIS tasks and workflows. The workshop will also cover how to create scripting tools in ArcGIS toolboxes for reuse and sharing. Participants will finish with the skills to explore more resources and options for utilizing Python in ArcGIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Topics Include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Work with the ArcPy Python site package for ArcGIS\n",
    "* Convert ModelBuilder models to Python scripts\n",
    "* Build and share stand-alone Python script tools for automation\n",
    "* Learn tips and tricks for valid script syntax and error handling\n",

    "## Computing and Software Needs\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your may use your own laptop, however computers are available in the lab\n",
    "\n",
    "* ArcGIS Desktop 10.x (Standard or Advanced preferred) or ArcGIS Pro 2.x\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python IDE\n",
    "    * <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/idle.html\" target=\"_blank\">IDLE</a> is also shipped with ArcGIS Desktop, so it can be used.\n",
    "    * <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscripter/files/\" target=\"_blank\">PyScripter</a> (**v. 3.0.2 32-bit** version) is good for ArcMap script development *NOTE: The zip files contain portable versions of PyScripter. No installation is needed. Just unzip the archive and start using PyScripter.*\n",
    "    * <a href=\"https://github.com/spyder-ide\" target=\"_blank\">Spyder IDE</a> is better for ArcGIS Pro development, however this requires special installaiton instuctions to make it work with ArcGIS, so do not install this prior to the workshop; I can deal with this on a case-by-case basis\n",
