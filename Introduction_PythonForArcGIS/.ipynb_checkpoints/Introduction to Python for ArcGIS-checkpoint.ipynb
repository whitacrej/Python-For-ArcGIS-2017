    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming tools are now a standard feature within GIS software packages and allow GIS users to automate, speed up, and become more precise in their data management and analytic work. This workshop is designed for GIS users who have little to no experience with computer programming and will cover core programming concepts related to GIS using the Python programming language. The workshop will focus on guiding attendees through hands-on exercises designed to provide the essential skills to programmatically manipulate data as part of a GIS workflow. This workshop is designed to be preparation for the following workshop on **Advanced Python for ArcGIS, but may be taken independently**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Topics Include:\n",
    "* Core Python programming concepts\n",
    "* Introduction to ArcPy site package for ArcGIS\n",
    "* Working with geospatial data using Python and ArcPy\n",
    "* Simple data management and geoprocessing tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing and Software Needs\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your may use your own laptop, however computers are available in the lab\n",
    "\n",
    "* ArcGIS Desktop 10.x (Standard or Advanced preferred) or ArcGIS Pro 2.x\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python IDE\n",
    "    * <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/idle.html\" target=\"_blank\">IDLE</a> is also shipped with ArcGIS Desktop, so it can be used.\n",
    "    * <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscripter/files/\" target=\"_blank\">PyScripter</a> (**v. 3.0.2 32-bit** version) is good for ArcMap script development *NOTE: The zip files contain portable versions of PyScripter. No installation is needed. Just unzip the archive and start using PyScripter.*\n",
    "    * <a href=\"https://github.com/spyder-ide\" target=\"_blank\">Spyder IDE</a> is better for ArcGIS Pro development, however this requires special installaiton instuctions to make it work with ArcGIS, so do not install this prior to the workshop; I can deal with this on a case-by-case basis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructor\n",
    "\n",
    "**James Whitacre**, GIS Specialist, University Library, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n",
    "\n",
    "As the GIS Specialist in the Main Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Mr. Whitacre's primary role is to provide GIS consultation and research assistance for faculty, staff, and students. Additionally, he teaches a myriad of GIS workshops for beginner to advanced users and helps manage the Library's GIS data and software assets. He is also a central resource for the GIS community on campus to promote the use of GIS in research. Mr. Whitacre holds a Master of Science in Geography and was previously the GIS Manager for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.\n"

    "\n",
    "> This package provides a rich and native Python experience offering code completion (type a keyword and a dot to get a pop-up list of properties and methods supported by that keyword; select one to insert it) and reference documentation for each function, module, and class.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The additional power of using ArcPy within Python is the fact that Python is a general-purpose programming language. It is interpreted and dynamically typed and is suited for interactive work and quick prototyping of one-off programs known as scripts while being powerful enough to write large applications in. ArcGIS applications written with ArcPy benefit from the development of additional modules in numerous niches of Python by GIS professionals and programmers from many different disciplines.\n",
